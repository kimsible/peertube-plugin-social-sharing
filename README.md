🙋 If you want to add a service, you may request it into an issue.

✋ **Before opening an issue**, some rules :

- The service must be relevant, **that means with an open API to share URLs**

- Most of famous proprietary services have already been implemented, so, priority to the [fediverse Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse)

- Not any **tracking features** will ever be implemented in the future
